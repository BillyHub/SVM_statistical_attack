### About

Implementation codes of the proposed statistical attacking methods on support vector machine (SVM).

#### To test the lower-bouned of error of probability by total variation distance (TVD), run:

```bash

```

#### To test the Chernoff bounds for estimating the upper-bound of error of probability, run:

```bash
chernoff_nick.m
```
